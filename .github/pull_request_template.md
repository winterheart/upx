IMPORTANT NOTE
==============

This repository does NOT accept pull requests, and if you do create one
it will get automatically deleted by a *Bot* without any review.

- if you want to contribute **a real C++ code bug-fix** then open an issue
on the main UPX issue tracker; we will have a look at the code in your
fork depending on the quality of your issue, and merge it if appropriate

- if you want to contribute **a new feature** then by all means open an issue
on the main UPX issue tracker first before starting any coding!

- do not mess with the docs, scripts, CI, makefiles, build system, spelling
errors, etc.; only open an issue if you're sure there is a **real bug**
